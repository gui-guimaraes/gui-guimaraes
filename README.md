I'm a software developer.
During my career, I chose to specialize in Frontend development, and worked with the main tools in this field, like VueJs, React, Angular and JQuery. Also with  UI libraries like Bootstrap, Materialize, and Vuetify.
In server-side applications, I worked with PHP (Laravel), NodeJs (Express), C#  (MVC 4),  and ASP 3. But most of the time, I'm focused on the client-side.

I'm also able to plan scalable architectures using DDD, clean architecture, unit tests, linters, bundler builders, automation scripts, micro front-end, and the most modern market practices.

Other skills I've developed over the years are knowledge of UX Design and its heuristics. Having performed interface improvement activities, to make them more intuitive for the user.

As a developer, my main goal is to build the interface designed by the UX/UI team with the highest possible fidelity, writing performative code, easy to understand and maintain. I try to find the best practices and patterns of code because a well-planned interface ensures that the code will survive over the years. 

When I'm not writing code, I like to spend time with family and friends. In addition, I am passionate about music, cinema, and literature.
